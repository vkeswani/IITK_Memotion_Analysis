In this repository, we present our approaches for the Sentiment Analysis of Internet Memes. The challenge was organized under the SemEval-2020 International Workshop (Task 8: Memotion Analysis).

Memes are essentially bimodal. They have both Text and Image components. We used both bimodal (text and image) and unimodal (text-only) approaches as listed below:
<ul><b>Bimodal</b>
  <li>FFNN+CNN+SVM</li>
  <li>MMBT</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Unimodal</b>
  <li>Naive Bayes</li>
  <li>FFNN with Word2vec</li>
  <li>BERT</li>
</ul>

The details of the architectures and performance are discussed in the corresponding paper which will be arriving soon.
